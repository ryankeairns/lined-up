# Lined Up

**Lined Up** is a deliberately low-fidelity wireframing tool for thinking through structure, hierarchy, and flow before visual design.

It is the digital equivalent of sketching on paper or drawing on a whiteboard: fast, rough, and intentionally constrained.

## Project Doctrine

This project is intentionally small, constrained, and free.

Lined Up exists to support early-stage thinking — not polished design, not production output, and not design handoff.

Constraints are a feature, not a limitation.

Forks are welcome. Feature inflation is not.

## When to use this (and when not to)

Use Lined Up when:
- You are exploring layout, hierarchy, or flow
- You want to think without committing to visual decisions
- Figma feels too powerful for what you’re trying to figure out

Do **not** use Lined Up when:
- You care about spacing precision, typography, or color
- You need stakeholder-ready visuals
- You are preparing final designs or developer handoff

When you start caring about visual polish, it’s time to move on to another tool.
